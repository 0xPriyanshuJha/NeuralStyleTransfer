# Neural Style Transfer using Pre-trained Model

This project demonstrates how to perform Neural Style Transfer using a pre-trained model available on Kaggle. The model used is [Arbitrary Image Stylization v1](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1/frameworks/TensorFlow1/variations/256/versions/2) by Google, implemented in TensorFlow.

## Introduction

Neural Style Transfer is a technique used to blend the style of one image (style image) with the content of another image (content image). This project uses a pre-trained model for arbitrary image stylization, allowing you to apply different artistic styles to any given content image.

## Features

- Use pre-trained TensorFlow models for fast and efficient stylization.
- Supports any content and style images.
- Simple interface to apply style transfer with minimal code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 1.x or compatible versions
- Kaggle API (for model download)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xPriyanshuJha/neural-style-transfer.git
   cd neural-style-transfer```
